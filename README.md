## Features

- **Small footprint**
- **Support the full `window.open` api**.
- **Built for React 16 and 17** (uses `ReactDOM.createPortal`).
- **Handler for blocked popups** (via `onBlock` prop).
- **Center popups** according to the parent _window_ or _screen_.
- **No external dependencies** Only React 16 or 17 as a _peer_ dependency.

### What's different from `react-new-window`?
- Codebase has been rewritten in TypeScript with many bugs discovered and fixed in the process.
- `closeWithParent` property indicating to close the new window when the parent window closes.
- Installation doesn't require the `--force` switch since **both** React 16 and 17 are supported.
- If the `title` property is missing the new window will use the parent window's title.
- The `features` property no longer require `height` and `width` if not given and the `center`
  property is set then this will default to `height: 600, width: 640`.  
- **Note:** Internet Explorer will no longer be supported. 

## Installation

```sh
npm i react-new-improved-window --save
```

## Usage

```js
import React from 'react'
import NewWindow from 'react-new-improved-window'

const Demo = () => (
  <NewImprovedWindow>
    <h1>Hi ðŸ‘‹</h1>
  </NewImprovedWindow>
)
```

When **`<NewImprovedWindow />`** is mounted a popup window will be opened. When unmounted then the popup will be closed.

The `children` contents is what will be rendered into the new popup window. In that case `Hi ðŸ‘‹` will be the content. The content can include any react-stateful code.

## Development

To start contributing to this project, please do:

1. Fork and clone this repo.
2. Make the changes you want to.
3. Create and push a PR.

To build the library you should have TypeScript installed globally `npm install -g typescript`

`npm run build`

## Test (example)

In the base directory:
```sh
cd example
npm install # You only need to do this once
npm start
```

This will start the example React App. The example app is linked directly to react-new-improved-window and will pick up
any changes made when the library is built.

See: `example/src/App.tsx`
